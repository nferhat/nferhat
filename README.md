## Hi there!

I am Nadjib Ferhat, a 15 year old high-school student, and for probably two or three years more.

<!-- todo add my portfolio -->

- Learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- Probably learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org) too.

### My current projects
> Nothing, yet...

### What I've used before and stopped using
- Javascript and [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- Nix, with [NixOS](https://nixos.org)
- [Lua](https://lua.org), but still use it sometimes for some scripts.
