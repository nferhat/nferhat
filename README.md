## Hi there!

I am Nadjib Ferhat, a 15 year old high-school student, and for probably two or three years more.

### My current projects
- Wayland compositor using [smithay](https://github.com/smithay/smithay) with custom wayland shell (currently wip+private)

### What I've used before and stopped using
- Javascript and [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- Nix, with [NixOS](https://nixos.org)
- [Lua](https://lua.org), but still use it sometimes for some scripts.
