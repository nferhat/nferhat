## Hi there!

I am Nadjib Ferhat, a 17 year old college student at University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene. Currently interested in Rust, Wayland and half-baked linux desktops.

### What do I do?

In my free time, I mostly develop tools that I like to use, most likely recreation of something I already used in the past, in order to
get a better understanding of what the tool does, or how an ecosystem works. My current passion right now is developing a desktop
environment.

- [`fht-compositor`](https://github.com/nferhat/fht-compositor): Wayland compositor using [smithay](https://github.com/smithay/smithay) with custom wayland shell
- `fht-shell`: (still private, not finished at all!) A custom desktop environment written from scratch with Rust and GTK4.

If I am not programming, I'll either be studying, or enjoy video games; notably vertical scrolling rythm games, in which I excel, like 
[osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu), [Quaver](https://github.com/quaver) and [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame). If not, you can
catch me on multiplayers with my friends playing Minecraft, or grinding Celeste mods.
