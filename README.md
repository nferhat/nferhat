## Hi there!

I am Nadjib Ferhat, a 15 year old high-school student, and for probably two or three years more.

<!-- todo add my portfolio -->

### What I'm interested into/learning
- Playing around and ricing linux, running [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) on a Hewlett-Packard da0018nk.
- Learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and probably [Zig](https://ziglang.org) too.

### What I've used before and stopped using
- Javascript and [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- Lua, but still use it sometimes for some scripts.
